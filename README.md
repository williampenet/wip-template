## How it was built

This project is part of **WiP – Vibe coding**, a series of products built by AI agents and steered by a product manager.

| Role | Who | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Product Manager | William Penet (human) | Problem framing, PRD, design and architecture sign-off, demo acceptance |
| Senior engineer & orchestrator | Claude (AI) | Stack choice, ADRs, backlog breakdown, agent orchestration |
| Dev / QA / Review agents | Claude sub-agents | One PR per Linear ticket, tests, code review |

**Pipeline** (✋ = human validation)

1. PRD ✋ → [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)
2. Design system + key mockups (Claude Design) ✋
3. Architecture, ADRs, monthly cost estimate ✋ → [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)
4. Backlog in Linear
5. Autonomous build: one PR per ticket, green CI required
6. Continuous deployment of `main`
7. Demo + narrative ✋

**Model choice** (if the product uses an LLM): {{chosen model, publisher, licence, hosting}} — selected against {{n}} candidates and a proprietary baseline. Quality {{x}} vs baseline {{y}}, cost {{z}}× lower. Details: [ADR]({{docs/adr/...}}) · [evaluation](docs/MODEL_EVAL.md).
The build agents are Claude (Anthropic); the sovereignty / open-weights policy applies to the model running inside the product.

**Human vs agent split:** see [`docs/BUILD_LOG.md`](docs/BUILD_LOG.md) for the dated log of every human and agent action.
